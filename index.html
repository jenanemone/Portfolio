            <p>When I was younger, I wanted to know everything about almost everything, and I wanted to understand every
                person who came into my life. With time and experience, I've managed to hone down my attention, and
                while
                I'm looking for ways to continue growing and learning, I realize that time and intention are limiting
                factors. This sort of unfettered curiosity has grown into a humanist urge to guide the world to a better
                status quo, but my interest in coding and making things has brought me to the point where today I'm
                building
                the world a little better, one webpage at a time. I've found what I love the most: coding. Coding gives
                me
                the tools to make the world a little more manageable, a bit more equitable, and a lot more friendly.
            </p>
            <p>It's true that I took a break from coding to run a wholesale and eCommerce reuse and recycle business. My
                biggest takeway from that experience has been to realize that completion trumps perfection, every time.
                Right now I'm building and coding, and providing consultation services. I'm still as committed as ever
                to
                learning, in whatever form it comes, and I hope I can help someone else on their journey, as well. The
                axiom
                seems truer all the time: the more you know, the more you realize you don't know.</p>
            <p>I'd love to grow my career with you, especially if you're committed to what you're doing, if you value
                people
                as the cause of and the purpose of your success, if you love to foster growth, and if you're looking to
                make
                the world a brighter place. If you're looking for someone to take ownership of your work or their role
                in
                your project, then let's talk further.</p>
